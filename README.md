# dutchies
----------
a mod which lets you customize the face cards into dutch face cards!<br>
<br>
(the art is very detailed so also kind of blurry, maybe i'll get a simplefied version in sometime)

-----
Q: how did you make the art? <br>
<br>
A: i took a pickture of google called: dutch face cards, then i put it into "pixelart" (actuall name of site).
then i fixed them up! (removing the background, fixing the cut off, all those things)
and last i fixed the code for each suit (using the example from SDM_0)
